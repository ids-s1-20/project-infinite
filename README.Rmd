## Summary

  	This data analysis has been a success and it has been fun researching something that we use every day. The dataset we used was 'USvideos', gives us analytical information about videos on YouTube such as the number of likes, views, dislikes, comment_count. Data varies from 2008 to 2018 with 10000 rows but reduced to half because the large dataset resulted in errors.
  	Our research question was "What makes a YouTube video popular?" We wanted to understand what exactly makes a YouTube video popular, is it the most amount of likes, comments, or views? It would be of course the number of views but videos such as 'Baby' by Justin Bieber which has a total of 11 million dislikes and a like to dislike ratio of 15:11. The absurd amount of dislikes disqualifies a video from being in the top 10 most popular videos. So to investigate our research question, we came out with five additional questions, what is the most viewed video, what category is uploaded most, during what time of day do YouTubers post, effects of clickbait on views, and a statistical question which asks "How many likes will a video with 7.8 billion views get?” In addition, we used the adjusted r squared and the root mean squared error to complement the statistical question.
  	To visualize our findings, we first had to combine the duplicate rows so we get a total value for each duplicate. To view the popular videos, we used the group_by function to group both title and views to help us visualize the videos by descending order. Next, we set a time frame to a time of day and ranked them to view the time which had the most amounts of uploads. In order to discover clickbait, we filtered the top videos with including exclamation marks, question marks and capital letters using the string package and ranked them by views, likes, and dislikes to determine if clickbait would cause viewers to dislike the video because of a misleading title. Lastly, we wanted to estimate how many likes a video would receive it were to reach 7.8 billion views. We selected the regression line by comparing the adjusted r squared and the root mean squared error of two different models.
    Our findings were somewhat surprising. We found that 3/5 of the top 5 YouTube videos were music videos, 1 of them was a trailer to the movie "The Avengers" and the last one was a YouTube Rewind of the most memorable videos on YouTube which was expected since the main purpose of Youtube is for music videos. It is evident because when we ran the code for the most common categories on Youtube, music was on top followed by comedy. Next, we found the frequency of the different times of day for uploading YouTube videos and turns out, majority of the uploads occur in the afternoon when people were either working or attending school. We thought that it would be uploaded during the evening because people had leisure time to watch Youtube videos. The most viewed videos were produced in the afternoon of music and comedy videos. The idea of clickbait was one of particular interest to us because we wanted to know if it impacts the view count and if it was worth while for them to deceive viewers to gain extra viewers at the cost of dislikes. Our research shows that by adding capital letters it will attract more views compared to a simple title. But the clickbait came at a cost nonetheless, they received more dislikes compared to the regular videos shown when we compared the proportions of dislikes to likes of all and clickbait videos. The proportions of dislikes showed that clickbait videos were two times more than all videos. We could assume that the larger comment count for clickbait could be a result of the viewers expressing their anger for the deception. Finally, we finished the data analysis with a least-squares regression. But before we decided on what line to draw, we tested the adjusted r squared and the root mean squared error of two models. We concluded that the appropriate equation for the regression line is y = 5212 plus (3/100)x, this implies that with 0 views a video would receive 4355 likes which doesn’t make sense. We calculated the r squared to have a value of 0.83 which was solid and it was enough to make statistical inferences on the data. Therefore, we applied the regression line to predicted the number of likes for the most popular video of 2017. "Échame La Culpa" would receive if it were to reach 2 billion views. While the difference in the predicted likes and actual likes in the video was off by approximately 53 million, we can infer a few things. People re-watch the video plenty of times which doesn't let them re-like the video or they don’t have a Google account which doesn’t allow them to like. We also used the regression line to predict the number of likes a video would receive if the whole human population watched one specific video. We approximated that it would receive 233 million likes, but we may never know how many likes that video would get because of government censorship and lack of wi-fi in some places of the world.

## Summary

   This data analysis has been a success and it has been fun researching something that we use every day. The dataset we used was 'USvideos', gives us analytical information about videos on YouTube such as the number of likes, views, dislikes, comment_count. Data varies from 2008 to 2018 with 10000 rows but reduced to half because the large dataset resulted in errors.

   Our research question was "What makes a YouTube video popular. Is it the most amount of likes, comments, or views? It would be of course the number of views but videos such as 'Baby' by Justin Bieber which has a total of 11 million dislikes and a like to dislike ratio of 15:11. The absurd amount of dislikes disqualifies a video from being in the top 10 most popular videos. So to investigate our research question, we came out with five additional questions, what is the most viewed video, what category is uploaded most, during what time of day do YouTubers post, effects of clickbait on views, and a statistical question which asks "How many likes will a video with 7.8 billion views get?” In addition, we used the adjusted r squared and the root mean squared error to complement the statistical question.
  	
   To visualize our findings, we first had to combine the duplicate rows. We viewed the most popular videos using the group_by function to group both title and views. Next, we set a time frame to a time interval and ranked them to determine the time of day with the most uploads. To discover clickbait, we filtered the top videos with capital letters using the string package and ranked them by views, likes, and dislikes to determine if clickbait caused viewers to dislike the video because of a misleading title. Lastly, we wanted to estimate how many likes a video would receive it were to reach 2 billion views. We selected the regression line by comparing the adjusted r squared and the root mean squared error of two different models.

   Our findings were somewhat surprising. We found that 3/5 of the top 5 YouTube videos were music videos, 1/5 was a movie trailer and the last one was a YouTube Rewind of the most memorable videos on YouTube. Music videos being the majority was expected as music videos are generally posted on Youtube, it is evident because the frequencies of common categories was music which was usually uploaded in the afternoon. Next, we found the frequency of the different times of day for uploading YouTube videos and turns out, majority of the uploads occur in the afternoon. We expected that it would be uploaded during the evening due to leisure time. 
   
   We were particularly interested in clickbait because we wanted to know if it impacts the view count and if it was worth while for them to deceive viewers to gain viewers at the cost of dislikes. Our research shows that by adding capital letters, it attracts more views compared to a simple title. Nonetheless the clickbait came at a cost, they received more dislikes compared to the regular videos. The proportions of dislikes showed that clickbait videos were two times more than all videos. We could assume that the larger comment count for clickbait could be a result of the viewers expressing their anger for the deception. Finally, we finished the data analysis with a least-squares regression. But before we decided on what line to draw, we tested the adjusted r squared and the root mean squared error of two models. There is no evident difference between their accuracies, so we decided to use the simpler model for prediction. We concluded that the appropriate equation for the regression line is y = 5212 plus (3/100)x, this implies that with 0 views a video would receive 4355 likes which doesn’t make sense. We calculated the r squared to have a value of 0.83 which was solid enough to make statistical inferences on the data. Therefore, we applied the regression line to predicted the number of likes for the most popular video, "Échame La Culpa" would receive if it had 2 billion views. While the difference in the predicted likes and actual likes in the video was off by approximately 53 million, we can infer a few things. People re-watch but they cannot re-like the videos or they don’t have a Google account which doesn’t allow them to like.

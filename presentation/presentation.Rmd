# Data Visualization

# Data Cleaning

- We had duplicate Youtube videos in separate rows so we merged the duplicate rows into one single row and also combined the views, likes and comments together.

- This allows for us to rank the with accuracy because it adds up the total of the duplicate rows and gives us total values. 
```{r cleaned, echo = FALSE}
USvideos = USvideos[order(USvideos[,'title'],- USvideos[,'views']),] 
  USvideos = USvideos[!duplicated(USvideos$title),]
```


---

# Most Viewed


```{r filtering, echo = FALSE}
USvideos %>% 
  group_by(title, views) %>% 
  arrange(desc(views)) %>%
  distinct(title, views)  %>%
  print(tbl_USvideos(USvideos), n = 17)
```

## During what times of day do Youtubers post?


```{r capital-letters, echo = FALSE}

```

.pull-left[
- Some text
- goes here
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger

```
]

# Time of Day 

- The different times of day used in previous slide is presented in military time or the 24-hour clock and it is defined below: 

- Morning: 06:00:00 ~ 11:59:59

- Afternoon: 12:00:00 ~ 17:59:59

- Evening: 18:00:00 ~ 23:59:59

# Question/Exclamation mark effects on popularity

- Is "clickbait" real? Does it affect the amount of traffic a video receives or is it just a theory. Are "clickbait" videos more prone to dislikes because of a misleading title?

```{r question-or-exclamation, echo=FALSE}
USvideos %>% 
  filter_all(any_vars(str_detect(str_to_lower(.), "\\?|\\!"))) %>%
  select(title, views, likes, dislikes, comment_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(views))
```

---


# What is the most popular category?

- If people wanted to become famous overnight, what category type will increase their chances of being famous. 
```{r popular-categories, echo=FALSE}
USvideos %>% 
  filter_all(any_vars(str_detect(str_to_lower(.), "\\?|\\!"))) %>%
  select(title, views, likes, comment_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(views))
```

# The Most Popular Video as of 2017

```{r thumbnail, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Luis Fonsi, Demi Lovato - Ã‰chame La Culpa"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://maddownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/luis-fonsi-demi-lovato-echame-la-culpa-08.jpg')

# Statistical Inferences 

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).
